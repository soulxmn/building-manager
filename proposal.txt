EXPANSION:  In the future, this project can be upscaled to a  Tentative layout of project.
            framework that connects both the client 
            (the corporation/company) and the construction 
            team with a single-sign-on online interface that 
            provides real-time updates pushed by the client to 
            the server, so that any changes can be easily and 
            quickly conveyed - this will also help keep a 
            record of all demands, agreed-upon prices and 
            deals, as well as provide a quick and efficient 
            way to respond to any construction problems that 
            may arise and that require client input or 
            verification before continuing.
